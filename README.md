Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### deployment

I've used the Vercel platform to deploy my application, if you want to push any changes on the deployment then just directly push your changes to the `master` branch.
